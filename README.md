Vehicle Emergency Alert System 

WE HAVE DESIGNED A PROTOTYPE UNIT OF A STANDALONE EMBEDDED SYSTEM USING PIC16F72 (MICROCHIP MICROCONTROLLER) WITH PERSON INPUT WHICH IS A EMERGENCY PUSH BUTTON AND VEHICLE INPUTS SUCH AS:-
->FIRE SENSING
->GLASS BREAKING
->VIBRATION MONITORING
->ACTIVATION OF AIRBAGS
THE SYSTEM USES A GSM/GPRS  MODULE FOR TRANSMITING THE MESSAGE TO THE AUTHORITIES.IT  HAS A RESET BUTTON TO RESET THE SYSTEM. THEN WE HAVE A BLUE LED WHICH INDICATES THAT THE MESSAGE TRANSMITION IS ON. THE RED LED IS THE VISUAL ALERT AND THE BUZZER IS THE AUDIO ALERT. 

WORKING OF THE SYSTEM

CASE:1->
WHEN THE EMERGENCY PUSH BUTTON IS ACTIVATED IT TRANSMITS THE MESSAGE WITHOUT ANY DELAY TO THE AUTHORITIES AND THE LED AND BUZZER CONTINUES TO BLINK AND BEEP RESPECTIVELY FOR A CERTAIN TIME UNTIL THE AUTHORITIES ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND RESET THE SYSTEM. 

CASE:2->
WHEN ANY ONE OF THE VEHICLE INPUT IS ACTIVATED THE LED AND THE BUZZER IS ACTIVATED AND WAITS FOR A FEW SECONDS FOR THE EMERGENCY PUSH BUTTON INPUT TO ACTIVATE TO TRANSMIT THE MESSAGE TO THE AUTHORITIES. 
IF EMERGENCY PUSH BUTTON INPUT IS NOT RECEIVED IT TRANSMITS THE MESSAGE AFTER THE WAIT TIME IS FINISHED.
